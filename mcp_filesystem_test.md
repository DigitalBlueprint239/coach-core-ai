# MCP Filesystem Server Setup Complete

## Installation Summary

✅ **MCP Documentation Loaded**: Successfully loaded MCP server creation documentation
✅ **Configuration File Updated**: Added filesystem server to cline_mcp_settings.json
✅ **Server Name**: `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/filesystem`
✅ **NPX Package Verified**: Confirmed @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem is working
✅ **Directory Access**: Configured for `/Users/jones/Desktop/Coach Core` and `/Users/jones/Desktop`

## Configuration Details

The MCP server has been configured with:
- **Command**: `npx`
- **Package**: `@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem`
- **Allowed Directories**: 
  - `/Users/jones/Desktop/Coach Core` (current project)
  - `/Users/jones/Desktop` (user's desktop)
- **Status**: `disabled: false`
- **Auto-approve**: `[]` (empty array as required)

## Available Tools (Once Connected)

The filesystem MCP server provides these tools:
- `read_file` - Read complete contents of a file
- `read_multiple_files` - Read multiple files simultaneously
- `write_file` - Create new file or overwrite existing
- `edit_file` - Make selective edits using pattern matching
- `create_directory` - Create new directory or ensure it exists
- `list_directory` - List directory contents with [FILE] or [DIR] prefixes
- `move_file` - Move or rename files and directories
- `search_files` - Recursively search for files/directories
- `get_file_info` - Get detailed file/directory metadata
- `list_allowed_directories` - List all directories the server can access

## Next Steps

1. **Restart Required**: The MCP system needs to restart to establish connection
2. **Test Connection**: Once connected, you can use commands like:
   - "List the allowed directories for the filesystem server"
   - "Read the contents of a specific file using the MCP filesystem server"
   - "Search for files in the project directory"

## Verification Test

The server was successfully tested manually:
```bash
npx -y @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem "/Users/jones/Desktop"
# Output: Secure MCP Filesystem Server running on stdio
# Output: Allowed directories: [ '/Users/jones/Desktop' ]
```

The setup is complete and the server will be available after system restart.
