# Coach Core AI – Investor Memo

## Company Snapshot
Coach Core AI builds the first AI-empowered coaching operating system. We empower human coaches with intelligent tools while protecting athlete privacy and complying with youth data regulations.

## Problem
Coaching staffs rely on fragmented spreadsheets, whiteboards, and siloed software (HUDL, manual planners, texting apps). No platform unifies practice planning, play design, analytics, and communication, and none integrate AI while respecting COPPA/FERPA.

## Solution
Coach Core AI delivers Smart Playbook as the flagship experience with an integrated OS: Practice Planner, Insights Hub, Strength & Conditioning, and Team Hub. Our AI suggestions keep coaches in control with human-in-loop approvals, transparent recommendations, and weekly value drops.

## Market
- 1M+ coaches across youth, high school, college segments.
- $5B+ TAM spanning coaching software, analytics, and training content.
- Initial focus: American football with expansion to other field/team sports in Year 2–3.

## Product
1. **Smart Playbook:** Drag-and-drop field canvas, AI-assisted play creation, animated routes, exports.
2. **Practice Planner:** Goal-driven scheduling, drill library, calendar sync.
3. **Insights Hub:** Weekly trend reports, next best actions, manual stats ingestion.
4. **Strength & Conditioning:** Position templates, progression logic, in/off-season toggles.
5. **Team Hub:** Attendance, injuries, messaging, parent/player read-only portals.

## Business Model
