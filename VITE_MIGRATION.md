# Vite Migration Summary

## Overview
The Coach Core AI project has been successfully migrated from Create React App to Vite.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Package Dependencies**
- Removed `react-scripts`
- Added `vite`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `vitest` and related dependencies
- Updated scripts in `package.json`:
  - `npm start` → `npm run dev`
  - `npm run build` → `npm run build` (now uses Vite)
  - `npm test` → `npm run test` (now uses Vitest)

### 2. **Configuration Files**
- Created `vite.config.ts` with:
  - React plugin configuration
  - Path aliases (`@` for `src/`)
  - Proxy configuration for API calls
  - Build optimization with manual chunks
- Created `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` with Vite-compatible settings
- Created `vitest.config.ts` for test configuration

### 3. **HTML Entry Point**
- Moved `index.html` from `public/` to root directory
- Updated to use Vite's module script loading
- Removed `%PUBLIC_URL%` placeholders

### 4. **Environment Variables**
- Already using `VITE_` prefix for all environment variables ✓
- Already using `import.meta.env` for accessing env vars ✓
- Updated `process.env.NODE_ENV` references to:
  - `import.meta.env.MODE` for environment mode
  - `import.meta.env.DEV` for development checks
  - `import.meta.env.PROD` for production checks

### 5. **Type Definitions**
- Created `src/vite-env.d.ts` with proper TypeScript definitions for all environment variables

### 6. **Test Setup**
- Created `src/setupTests.ts` for Vitest configuration
- Added testing library dependencies

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Faster Development** - Vite's HMR is significantly faster than CRA
2. **Smaller Bundle Size** - Better tree-shaking and optimization
3. **Modern Tooling** - Native ES modules support
4. **Better Performance** - Faster builds and dev server startup

## Next Steps

1. Run `npm install` to install new dependencies
2. Use `npm run dev` to start the development server
3. Use `npm run build` to create production builds
4. Update CI/CD pipelines to use new commands

## Breaking Changes

- Development server now runs on `http://localhost:3000` (configured in vite.config.ts)
- Build output is in `/build` directory (configured to match CRA structure)
- Test runner changed from Jest to Vitest (mostly compatible API)

## Notes

- Firebase integration remains unchanged
- All existing features and functionality preserved
- Environment variable structure maintained with VITE_ prefix
